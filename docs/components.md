# Component Map

`dcloud` is organized as a set of independent components with clear
boundaries.

## Control Plane

- `console`: React/Vite UI for operators and users, with the local identity login page
- `api`: FastAPI boundary for browser and external clients, reading the session cookie and querying `identity`

## Service Plane

- `project`: project lifecycle and tenant-level metadata
- `container`: container lifecycle and deployment records

## Data Plane

- `database`: PostgreSQL backing store shared by `api`, `identity`, `project`, and `container`

## Notes

- There is no `core` component anymore.
- `services/` is gone; top-level directories are the deployable units.
- Authentication is handled by `identity`; `api` does not store passwords, but it does forward sessions to `identity`.
- Shared API shapes live in `proto/` and shared Go bindings live in
  `internal/pb/`.
